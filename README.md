# Description
Esell is a public and free to use e-commerce template. Esell includes the ability to offer eight separate products. The model also provides Discord server invites and Telegram group invites.

# Deployment
To deploy Esell, you will need a web host. There are only a couple of things you need to edit to make Esell fit your products. First, add all your images to the Images file. Edit each product information to meet the product you are selling. Then get a PayPal seller's button, and paste the code in the <div> that has the class "pay-button." Get a new PayPal button for each of your products. Remember to make sure the Discord and Telegram contact information is correct!
